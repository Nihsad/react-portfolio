# 20: React Portfolio

This repository contains the second challenge for the full stack bootcamp course.

## Description

The purpose of this week's assignment was to put together a new portfolio, this time utilizing the React.js library. The intention is to help us stand out from other developers who may not be utilizing the latest, breaking-edge technology. 

The portfolio is deployed to netlify, which can be found [here](https://morgan-carmichael.netlify.app/).
